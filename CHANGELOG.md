## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-24

First runnable build. Builds and launches on Android with full UI scaffolding
and core playback wiring in place. iOS code-compatible but not yet built (build
requires macOS).

### Added
- **Audio engine** on `just_audio` + `just_audio_background` — gapless
  playback, background, lockscreen / MediaSession / Android Auto / CarPlay
  controls.
- **Subsonic client** with salt+token auth (`ping`, `getAlbumList2`,
  `getRandomSongs`, `getArtists`, `getArtist`, `getAlbum`, `search3`,
  `getPlaylists`, `getPlaylist`, `getLyrics`, `getCoverArt`, `stream`).
- **Local library** via our own Kotlin `MethodChannel` (`digaudio/media_store`):
  `MediaStore` audio query + artwork via `ContentResolver.loadThumbnail` —
  zero third-party plugin dependency.
- **Source-agnostic domain model** (`Track` / `Album` / `Artist` / `Playlist`
  + `MediaOrigin`). The audio engine and UI never branch on origin.
- **Offline downloads** infrastructure (Subsonic → local cache, drift-backed
  index with sync in-memory lookup for the engine).
- **Drift (SQLite) database** for downloads, favorites, local playlists,
  recent plays.
- **Riverpod-based wiring** — one central `providers.dart` exposes the full
  graph (settings, server config, Subsonic client, engine, downloads,
  library, search, browse data).
- **Dark, content-first UI** inspired by Spotify / Symfonium with a single
  vivid accent (`#1ED760`).
- **App shell** with bottom navigation (Home / Search / Library) and a
  persistent mini player that opens the full Now Playing screen on tap.
- **Now Playing** screen with full-screen artwork, transport controls,
  shuffle / repeat, seek slider, queue tab, lyrics tab.
- **Album / Artist / Playlist** detail pages.
- **Unified search** across local + Subsonic.
- **Settings** screen with secure Subsonic credential storage
  (`flutter_secure_storage`), ping/test before save.
- GPL-3.0 licensed.

### Technical decisions
- **Replaced abandoned `on_audio_query` plugin** with our own MediaStore
  MethodChannel (~50 lines Kotlin + ~30 Dart). Eliminates the AGP 8 namespace
  build failure at the root and removes the dependency rot. See `CLAUDE.md`
  principle #3.
- **`minSdk = 29`** (Android 10+) — enables `ContentResolver.loadThumbnail`
  for artwork in one line, drops compatibility cruft.
- **`MainActivity extends AudioServiceActivity`** so the activity returns the
  cached `FlutterEngine` that `audio_service` expects (root cause of the
  startup `PlatformException` — fixed properly, not papered over).
